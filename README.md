# SoftEngProject2
Software Engineering Project from Semester 2
This project documents the development and testing of an extended USE model for a
restaurant booking system, with the original version discussed in class used as a base
skeleton. As required, three new additional use cases were implemented, business
constraints using OCL were enforced and correctness was demonstrated through state
machines, object diagrams, testing using SOIL scripts as well as openter and opexit to
confirm the validity of the post and preconditions.
